To further strengthen the security of our remote login processes and password management, I recommend implementing the following best practices:

Use Key-Based SSH Authentication Only
Disable password authentication altogether and enforce SSH key pairs for all users. This greatly reduces the risk of brute-force attacks.

Change Default SSH Port
Move SSH service from the default port 22 to a non-standard port to reduce automated attack attempts.

Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Implement 2FA for SSH logins to add an additional security layer beyond username and password or key.

Use Fail2Ban or Similar Tools
Deploy intrusion prevention tools like Fail2Ban to monitor login attempts and automatically block suspicious IP addresses after repeated failures.

Limit User Access via AllowUsers or AllowGroups
Restrict SSH login to only specific users or groups who require remote access.

Regularly Update and Patch Systems
Ensure the server and SSH software are up to date with the latest security patches.

Enforce Strong Password Policies
For any remaining password-based access, enforce complexity, expiration, and history policies to prevent weak or reused passwords.

Monitor Logs and Use IDS/IPS
Continuously monitor SSH logs and network activity, and use Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems to detect and respond to suspicious behavior.
