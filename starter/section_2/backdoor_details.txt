# Provide the backdoor entries created by the nation state attackers. 

# Rouge Username
voldemort, darklord
Justification:
These usernames are not standard system accounts and were found in the /etc/passwd file and authentication logs (/var/log/auth.log) showing suspicious login attempts. They were created by the attackers to maintain persistent access.

# Backdoor process name
remotesec Running as: root (PID 973)
Justification:
The backdoor process runs with root privileges to evade detection under the rogue user's name. The process name "remotesec" is not a standard Linux service and was found listening on an unusual high-numbered port.

# Backdoor port number the above process is listening on
56565 (TCP)
Justification:
The backdoor process "remotesec" listens on TCP port 56565, which is a non-standard port typically used for legitimate services. The use of such a port is a tactic to avoid raising suspicion.

Actions Taken:
- Rogue usernames 'voldemort' and 'darklord' have been deleted.
- The backdoor process 'remotesec' has been terminated to remove persistence.
